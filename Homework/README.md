# Software Design and Architecture

## Homework 1

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop a system that automates the processes and
activities of ATMs in our country. By using OpenStreetMap and filtering the data, we will
create an app that will show all ATMs of every bank and some information about them
such as whether the ATM is working or not. After developing this system, we believe
that it is going to be a quite simple but useful web application.

By opening the web app, a list of ATMs will be shown to the user from which a user can
select one and get more info about it (whether the ATM is available or not). After
sharing its location, the user will have a list of the ATMs that are close to him and the
distance to that ATM. Users can also filter ATMs by a bank which will show only that banks'
ATMs.

This web application will be accessible from every browser and relatively easy to use as
everything shown will be user-friendly. As the app is small and consisting of small
amount of data, app functionalities such as filtering, searching and every other functionality
 is going to be simple and have an almost instant result.

## Requirements

## Functional:

- The app shall list the ATMs by their distance, closest to furthest.
- The app shall show the distance from usersâ€™ location to the selected ATM.
- The user will be able to filter ATMs by bank by selecting a bank.
- The app will show each ATMs availability (whether the ATM is working or not).
- The app shall be able to show only selected banks ATMs.

## Non-functional:

- The app shall be extremely easy to use for an average laptop user.
- The app shall be able to run on different operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
    and support most browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc.
- The app shall show the required results very quickly.
- The app will use very small amount of memory and will not conflict with other
    programs/processes.
- The system shall not encounter failures if all the necessities are provided (such as an
    internet connection and a PC/laptop with a relatively new OS).
